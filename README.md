# Neural_Networks_With_Numpy

Implementation of ANN, CNN, RNN with using only Numpy!

This repository demonstrates that the world of machine learning extends far beyond 
popular deep-learning frameworks like Tensorflow or PyTorch.

Three notebooks are containing the implementation of:
* Artificial Neural Network
* Convolutional Neural Network
* Recurrent Neural Network

And everything only using 'Numpy'...

Finally, there is an implementation of 'MNIST Classification' without a deep learning framework, just Numpy.

If you like my work, please smash that :star: button :smiley:.
